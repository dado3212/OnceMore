# OnceMore

OnceMore is a Cydia tweak that adds a restart button to the lock screen when a timer ends to restart the timer.

### Installation

To install it, either install from the .deb, or compile it yourself from the source.  Currently not on my repo because I've only tested it on my own device, and in a limited state.
